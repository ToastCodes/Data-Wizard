# Things To Note About Hackintoshing:
1. A hackintoshed PC is not a daily driver, it is incredibly unstable and is more of a fun project.
2. Time and patience, hackintoshing is very time consuming. 
3. Know your hardware, know what the specs of your GPU, CPU and RAM.
4. You need basic knowledge of CMD (Command Prompt)
5. 16GB USB to put macOS on.
6. You also need 30GB of free space on your device.
7. Have latest BIOS installed.

# Have you installed an OS before?

- Hackintoshing starts the same way installing any OS starts.
- If you have not installed an OS before it is worth practicing by installing Linux onto a device of on a virtual machine.
- If you have not installed an OS before I would not recommend Hackintoshing as it will come as a shock to the difficulty.
**Note: Hackintoshing can cause rage :D**
